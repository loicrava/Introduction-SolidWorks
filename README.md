# Part 1 : Description of the Environement

No needs to use it Until Part 2

## Point of View

Here are the different ways of seeing your object (front, bottom, top, bottom, left, right, back...).

## Shape

The different types of shape you want to give your object (rectangle starting from the center, arc on 3 points, semi-circle...).

## Measure (intelligent quotation)

The most important device when you want to give precise values to a length (side of a square, radius of a circle, length of a triangle...).

## Point of View Contructable

This is the point of view from which you want to build your object.

## Manipulation of Volume

With these devices you can create volume from a body.

# Part 2 : Manipulation of the environnement

## Step 1 Make a Square with Volume (Enix ðŸ‘·)

Try to make a square in the front plan (Plan de face ðŸ¥–)

First, select face plan where you are going to put your square shape.

![Step_One_Face_Plan](https://github.com/loicrava/Introduction-SolidWorks/assets/114694290/4a05a23d-84d5-4709-b674-fec1a7629c33)

Then select rectangle from the center in shape. 

![Step_One_Cube_Shape](https://github.com/loicrava/Introduction-SolidWorks/assets/114694290/f0eb19d1-7d65-4e37-b89a-bc7854023f7b)

Select Face Plan.
![Step_One_Select_FacePlan_Build](https://github.com/loicrava/Introduction-SolidWorks/assets/114694290/c9bab730-838c-465c-9eee-bbbc84a91b57)

Now Start from the center of the plan.

![Step_One_Select_Center](https://github.com/loicrava/Introduction-SolidWorks/assets/114694290/0bc9ada9-86c0-4e1a-94c5-9be3b3fb2ad9)

Then you extend your shape and Enter.

![Step_One_Extend_Shape](https://github.com/loicrava/Introduction-SolidWorks/assets/114694290/e659a3d8-12a8-4a45-aad9-42e15ed76fd3)

In a second time we want to give real measure to our shape, so choose cotation then a side of your shape. 

![Step_One_Cotation_Shape](https://github.com/loicrava/Introduction-SolidWorks/assets/114694290/98685f7c-da8b-49b1-91a5-5555f4bbe756)

The Cotation is Implemented so next click on it and give it a 40 mm lenght then do the same with the other side.

![Step_One_GiveCotation_Measure](https://github.com/loicrava/Introduction-SolidWorks/assets/114694290/f2f6e1fe-4cf6-4c1d-b41a-00ac250b322c)

Now we want our square to take some volume, so go in function then select "Brossage ExtrudÃ©".

![Step_One_Give_Volume](https://github.com/loicrava/Introduction-SolidWorks/assets/114694290/6313e7fe-2033-49f5-9d68-53d62afa72b4)

So now give it 40 mm of height like in the example.

![Step_One_Finale_Cube](https://github.com/loicrava/Introduction-SolidWorks/assets/114694290/3ffdaa04-4f7d-44db-b117-085a46e1f5e7)

Congratulations you juste Make a Cube !

## Step 2 Make a Hole

Since you have success the step 1 now try to put a hole in the Square.

Thanks to the volume function and the shape select a face of your cube and make a Hole !

## Step 3 Object Font

Font your Objet to make it malliable

(Search "CongÃ© function" on internet if you need)


## Step 4 Add an extension of your Object

Make an other volume starting to a face of your Object !
Select a face then pull a triangle a circle a rectangle a square whatever you want,
it must start from your object .

# Part 3: Create Your Own Object

## Create an Objet of your Choice 

(Glasses, mouse, air pods, a coin ect...)

### attendance will be recorded by presenting this object at the end of the workshop
